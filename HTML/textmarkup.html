        <h1>Text Markups</h1>
        <h2>Tags</h2>
        <p>Heading tags go from h1 to h6 and the above two bold lines are h tags<hr></p>
        <p>P-tags are used to store paragraphs like this one and the above line. Now to give a break in the paragraph while using p tags we write br in b/w lines like now.<br>Now to get a horizontal at a point we can give by hr like this.<hr> </p>
        <pre>But to store info where when we enter in code the output also enters we PRE.
Like now.No need to write br.<hr>
        </pre>
